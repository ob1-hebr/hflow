# Run HFlow pipelines with Airflow

Your pipeline already works: `app.test("episode_0001.mcap")` runs every check
in-process, in seconds, with no Docker and no scheduler. This page is the
graduation step: running **the same pipeline, unchanged**, as an Airflow DAG.
`hflow up` provisions a local Airflow in Docker Compose, `hflow ingest`
triggers runs over batches of episodes, Airflow's own UI shows every step, and
`hflow curate` cuts datasets from what landed in the catalog.

Nothing here is required for development. Iterate with `app.test()`; come here
when you want a scheduler doing the running (mapped batches, retries, a UI
with per-task logs) instead of your terminal.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker with Compose v2** (the `docker compose` subcommand). That is the
  entire requirement: Airflow is never a pip dependency of HFlow. The SDK
  renders files and speaks the REST API; it never imports Airflow.
- **~2 GB of one-time downloads.** The first `up` pulls the Airflow and
  Postgres images and builds the task venv; later starts reuse both.
- **Windows: use WSL2.** Run HFlow inside a WSL2 distribution (with Docker
  Desktop's WSL2 backend), and keep the data root on the Linux filesystem:
  the bundle records your Unix UID for container file ownership and bind-mounts
  the data root, both of which assume a Linux-side path.

No cloud account, no billing, no telemetry: everything below is containers on
your machine, and the only recurring costs are disk and CPU.

## What `up` builds: anatomy of the bundle

```bash
hflow up --pipeline pipeline.py --data-root ./data
```

(or, equivalently, `app.run()` under an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard in
the pipeline file itself; unguarded, the runtime's own workers would re-run
it when they import your pipeline.)

This renders a self-contained bundle at `<data-root>/runtime` (override with
`--bundle-dir`) that you can inspect, edit, and drive with plain
`docker compose`. The SDK provisions the runtime; it never *becomes* the
runtime:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yaml` | The official Airflow 3.3.1 reference compose reduced to LocalExecutor: `postgres`, `airflow-init`, `user-venv-init`, `airflow-apiserver`, `airflow-scheduler`, `airflow-dag-processor`, `airflow-triggerer`. No Redis, no Celery worker. The API binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Overwritten on every re-render. |
| `.env` | Generated secrets (JWT secret, admin password), the API port, image tags, your UID. **Create-if-absent**: written once at `0600`, never overwritten by a re-render; your secrets and edits survive, and what's on disk wins over config. |
| `dags/` | The five generated DAG files (below): the master `ingest.py` (`dag_id` defaults to `<pipeline stem>_ingest`) plus the four stage sub-DAGs `ingest_sync.py` / `ingest_meta.py` / `ingest_labels.py` / `ingest_media.py` (`<stem>_sync` etc.). |
| `user/` | A copy of your pipeline file and requirements, mounted read-only into the containers. Refreshed on every re-render; re-run `up` after editing your pipeline. |
| `logs/` | Airflow task logs, readable from the host. |

Two details exist because their absence bites:

- **A unique Compose project name.** Without one, Compose names every project
  after the bundle directory's basename (`runtime` for every default bundle),
  and two bundles on one machine would silently adopt each other's containers
  and share volumes (`down --volumes` in one would wipe the other's database).
  Each bundle gets a name derived from its absolute path.
- **The user venv.** The worker carries two Python environments: Airflow's
  own, and a venv built from your `--requirements` file inside a named
  volume. Every DAG task runs in *your* venv via `@task.external_python`, so
  your dependencies and Airflow's ~128 pins never meet. The venv is keyed to a
  content hash of your requirements and the HFlow source: unchanged inputs
  skip the rebuild entirely; a changed requirements file rebuilds exactly
  once. Provisioning also pre-warms HFlow's pinned ffmpeg into the same
  volume, so the download happens under your eyes at `up` time instead of
  stalling the first task (best-effort: air-gapped provisioning still
  succeeds, and the task-time fallback remains).

Pre-v1 source-install note: the task venv installs hflow from a source
checkout inferred from the imported package. Pass
`--hflow-source /path/to/hflow` when the checkout cannot be inferred,
such as when the CLI was launched from an installed wheel.

## The loop

**1. `up`.** The first start takes minutes, and narrates so it never looks
hung: rendering the bundle, pulling images and building the venv, a ~15 s
heartbeat while Airflow's components come up, then waiting for all five
ingest DAGs (the master and its four sub-DAGs) to actually register. `up`
only declares victory once every one is triggerable, so an immediate `ingest`
never 404s and the master never fires at an unregistered sub-DAG. It ends by
printing what you need:

```text
Airflow UI:  http://127.0.0.1:8080
credentials: airflow / <generated password>
ingest DAG:  pipeline_ingest
bundle:      data/runtime
ingest with: hflow ingest <episode-uri> --bundle-dir data/runtime
```

**2. `ingest`.** Trigger the master DAG over episode files, by path **relative
to the data root** (they resolve against `/opt/airflow/data` inside the
containers, so absolute host paths and `../` escapes are rejected before
anything is triggered):

```bash
hflow ingest episodes-in/run_0001.mcap episodes-in/run_0002.mcap
```

Two flags select what runs and how:

- **`--profile`** picks the run profile: which stage sub-DAGs the master
  enables. `full` (default) runs everything; `metadata_backfill` re-runs only
  checks + catalog registration; `relabel` re-runs only enrichments (the
  canonical files are never rewritten). Same graph, different toggles. Note
  the catalog stays idempotent per episode content and step versions: a
  backfill or relabel pass appends rows when something actually changed (an
  updated check or enrichment is a new content-hash version); re-running
  identical steps over identical episodes is a recorded no-op, not duplicate
  evidence.
- **`--online`** selects the latency-first trigger lane: the sub-DAGs process
  the URIs as **one immediate batch**, no bin-packing, no stagger delays.
  Meant for one run per episode as it lands (a collection rig posting each
  finished file); the default batch lane staggers near-equal-byte batches for
  throughput over shards.

This wraps Airflow's REST API v2 `dagRuns` endpoint with
`{"uris": [...], "profile": "full", "mode": "batch"}` in the run conf. A
collection rig or upload script can call the same endpoint directly, no CLI
required (`"mode": "online"` is the `--online` lane).

**3. Watch it.** `hflow ui` (see [UI.md](./UI.md)) shows runs live with
per-stage status, and opening a run shows its pipeline stage by stage: how
many episodes each stage has finished, the pace and time left on the one
running, and a warning when a stage goes quiet for well past its own pace.
Clicking a stage shows what its checks found and the batch tasks that did the
work; the master DAG's own tasks stay one level down, behind the run page's
Task graph link. For logs, retries, and re-runs, follow a task's link into
Airflow's own screens, exposed on localhost -- or open the printed URL and log
in with the printed credentials directly (the dashboard serves them too).

**4. `curate`.** Every processed episode appended rows to the Parquet catalog
under the data root, the same files whether the run came from `app.test(...,
record=True)` or the DAG:

```bash
hflow curate "SELECT episode_id, uri FROM episodes WHERE status != 'quarantined'" \
    -o manifest.parquet
```

See [the catalog guide](./CATALOG.md) for the views and the query patterns.

## The five ingest DAGs: a master and Figure 4's sub-DAGs

> **Dyna Figure 4 fidelity.** This is Dyna's published ingestion shape,
> implemented literally: a master DAG resolves the run profile and triggers
> only the sub-DAGs it enables. Two trigger lanes lead in: online
> (per-episode, latency-first) and batch (per-shard, staggered).

**The master (`<stem>_ingest`)** runs entirely in Airflow's own environment:
no user venv, no hflow import. A `resolve_profile` branch task validates
the conf's `profile` against the profile vocabulary (baked in from
`hflow.steps.RUN_PROFILES` at render time, so the runner and the DAGs can
never disagree), then one `TriggerDagRunOperator` per **enabled** stage fires
its sub-DAG and waits for it (deferrable; the triggerer service carries the
wait), chained strictly `sync → meta → labels → media`. Disabled stages show
as skipped tasks in the UI; a failed sub-DAG stops the chain and fails the
master run.

**What you see in the Airflow UI.** Every generated DAG is tagged with your
pipeline's stem, so one click on that tag in the DAG list filters to exactly
this pipeline's five DAGs (plus a `master` / `stage:<name>` role tag each).
Display names read as `<stem> · ingest (master)` and `<stem> · <stage>`, each
DAG's **Docs** tab renders a generated explainer (the master's includes the
profile table, baked from the same vocabulary the runner uses), and profile
toggling is visible live: a disabled stage shows as skipped tasks, while a
teal **deferred** trigger task is intentionally waiting on its sub-DAG; its
display name says so. Direct per-stage reruns show up in that sub-DAG's own
run history, which is the demo view of "same graph, different sub-DAGs
enabled."

**The four sub-DAGs** are each `plan → process_batch (mapped) → gate`, every
task running in your venv, and each runs exactly its own stage via
`app.process(uri, stages={...})`:

| sub-DAG | stage | gate |
|---|---|---|
| `<stem>_sync` | Transform & sync: the canonical transform (critical path) | error budget |
| `<stem>_meta` | Metadata: checks + catalog registration | **quarantine budget** + error budget |
| `<stem>_labels` | Labels & artifacts: enrichments (non-critical) | error budget |
| `<stem>_media` | Media: derived media (contact sheets) | error budget |

1. **`plan`** bin-packs the conf's URIs into near-equal-*byte* batches
   (first-fit-decreasing over file sizes, which vary widely and unbalance
   workers otherwise) and assigns each batch a staggered start
   delay. Batch count defaults to `min(4, episodes)`; override per run with
   `"batch_count"` in the conf. In **online mode** it instead returns the
   URIs as one immediate batch: no packing, no stagger, `batch_count`
   ignored.
2. **`process_batch`**, dynamically mapped over the batches, sleeps its
   stagger delay, imports your pipeline, and calls `app.process(uri,
   stages={<stage>})` per episode with catalog recording on: the same code
   path as `app.test()`, same gate semantics, same quarantine tags. A
   per-episode exception or collected step error is counted and skipped,
   never batch-fatal, so one corrupt file cannot sink its batch-mates.
3. **The gate** sums the counts and fails the run loudly over the budget of
   `max(8, ⌈1% of total⌉)` (and a run where every episode errors always
   fails). Checks decide quarantine, so the **quarantine half of the budget
   lives only in `_meta`'s `quarantine_budget_gate`**; the other stages keep
   the `error_budget_gate` half. Quarantine is a tag, never a deletion. The
   gate does not undo any work; it makes mass failure visible instead of
   letting a run that quarantined half its input report green.

## The one rule: `data_root="/opt/airflow/data"`

Your `--data-root` directory is mounted at `/opt/airflow/data` inside every
container, and that is where episode URIs resolve and outputs land. Your
pipeline's App must therefore be constructed with exactly that path:

```python
app = hflow.App("my-pipeline", data_root="/opt/airflow/data")
```

An App pointing anywhere else would silently write into the container
filesystem, so the rule is enforced twice: a **render-time warning** when `up`
sees a differing `data_root=` literal in your pipeline file (best-effort
textual scan, minutes earlier than the real check), and a **run-time
refusal**, where the process task raises before touching any episode when the
imported App's `data_root` differs. The mounted directory is shared both
ways: the catalog and canonical episodes the containers write are ordinary
files on your host.

(Yes, this means the dev-loop and runtime data roots differ. Point the App at
`/opt/airflow/data` and pass `output_dir=` to `app.test()` while iterating, or
flip the literal when you graduate; the run-time check catches a forgotten
flip loudly either way.)

## Bucket data roots: `--data-root gs://bucket/prefix`

The Compose runtime also runs directly against an object store, the shape
production robot fleets actually have (robots upload to a bucket; nothing
lands on the machine running Airflow):

```bash
hflow up --pipeline pipeline.py --data-root gs://my-bucket/robot-data
hflow ingest landing/run_0001.mcap
```

What changes against local mode, all decided at render time:

- **No data mount.** Episodes never touch the host filesystem; the App is
  constructed with the bucket URL itself
  (`data_root="gs://my-bucket/robot-data"`; the same one-rule check applies,
  now against the URL). URIs in ingest conf are keys under the prefix.
- **The task venv gets the `[bucket]` extra** (obstore) and every task spools
  through an etag-validated local mirror under the containers'
  `XDG_CACHE_HOME` (the user-venv volume), so downloads persist across
  container restarts and are shared by all stages.
- **The bundle defaults to `./runtime`** (a bucket has no local directory to
  host it; override with `--bundle-dir`), and XCom's file store moves to the
  bundle-local `xcom/` directory. `ingest`/`status`/`down` look in
  `./data/runtime` and then `./runtime` automatically, so the commands above
  work without `--bundle-dir`.
- **Credentials pass through, never in.** GCS: on GCE/GKE the containers
  reach the instance metadata server and need nothing at all; elsewhere the
  renderer mounts your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` file (or gcloud's
  application-default-credentials file) read-only. S3/Azure: the standard
  environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`…, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`…)
  are wired through as `${VAR}` references for the variables set in your
  shell at render time (variable *names* only; values never land in the
  bundle). Export the credentials before `up` (and before any later
  `docker compose up`), and re-run `up` after changing *which* variables you
  use.

Canonical episodes, contact sheets, sync-completion markers, and catalog
appends all publish back to the bucket; `hflow curate --catalog
gs://my-bucket/robot-data/catalog` then works from any machine with read
access.

## `status`: diagnostics

```bash
hflow status
```

prints the API URL, Airflow's own per-component health, and the
`docker compose ps` service table, plus a plain-language hint for each
unhealthy component, because component names don't explain consequences:

```text
health:  UNHEALTHY (dag_processor=unhealthy, metadatabase=healthy, ...)
hint:    dag_processor is unhealthy: DAG files are not being parsed, so the
         ingest DAG never appears or updates -- check `docker compose logs
         airflow-dag-processor`
```

The SDK explains; Airflow's UI observes. For anything deeper, the bundle is
plain Compose: `docker compose --file data/runtime/docker-compose.yaml logs
<service>` is endorsed usage.

## `down`: what stops, what survives

```bash
hflow down              # stop containers; all state survives
hflow down --volumes    # full reset: also remove the named volumes
```

Plain `down` stops the containers; the next `up` is fast. `--volumes`
additionally discards the two named volumes:

- **the Postgres volume**, Airflow's metadata DB: run history, task states,
  the admin user (recreated from `.env` on the next `up`);
- **the user-venv volume**: the built venv and the pinned-ffmpeg cache; the
  next `up` rebuilds and re-downloads both.

Your **data root is not a volume** and is never touched by `down`: episodes,
the catalog, and manifests survive even a `--volumes` reset. So does the
bundle's `.env` (it's a file, and re-renders preserve it); delete the bundle
directory itself if you want fresh secrets.

## Bring-your-own Airflow: `hflow deploy`

If you already operate an Airflow 3 deployment (Astronomer, Amazon MWAA,
Cloud Composer, or self-managed), skip the Compose runtime entirely:

```bash
hflow deploy --pipeline pipeline.py --data-root-uri s3://my-bucket/robot-data
```

This emits plain files under `./deploy/` and calls no platform API: the same
five ingest DAGs the Compose runtime generates (one set of templates, rendered
against your data root and your workers' venv interpreter, overridable with
`--venv-python`; each file is named after its dag id so synced dags/ folders
never collide),
your `user/` files, an `.airflowignore` so platforms that sync `user/` inside
the dags folder never parse your pipeline in Airflow's own environment, and a
**`DEPLOY.md`** with the concrete values already filled in: where `dags/` and
`user/` go per platform, the `HFLOW_USER_DIR` environment variable that
tells the DAG where `user/` landed, the task venv's package list, and the
trigger call.

The data root must be a supported object-store prefix (`s3://`, `gs://`, or
Azure) or an absolute filesystem path every worker mounts. Relative paths
cannot mean the same thing on remote workers, so they are refused at render
time. Bucket deployments install the `hflow[bucket]` extra in the task venv,
use the provider's standard credentials, and spool processing through an
etag-validated local mirror. Set `HFLOW_MIRROR_DIR` to place that cache on
appropriate worker-local storage. Canonical episodes, artifacts, completion
markers, catalog appends, and curation manifests publish back to the bucket.

## Troubleshooting

**An ingest DAG never appears / `ingest` keeps 404ing.** Health can be green
while a DAG file fails to import; component health says nothing about
parsing. Check the parser's logs:

```bash
docker compose --file data/runtime/docker-compose.yaml logs airflow-dag-processor
```

`up` itself waits for registration and, on timeout, points here; a 404 from
`ingest` prints the same hint (right after a fresh `up`, the DAG may still
be parsing; retry in a few seconds).

**Port 8080 is taken.** The port lives in the bundle's `.env` as `API_PORT`
(re-renders don't change a preserved `.env`, so editing it sticks):
`hflow down`, edit `API_PORT`, `hflow up` again. The API only ever binds
to `127.0.0.1`, so two bundles on different ports coexist fine.

**`up` failed partway.** Whatever started is deliberately left running: the
state *is* the diagnosis. `hflow status` to look, `docker compose ... logs
<service>` to dig, `hflow down` to clear it.

**Edited the pipeline, runtime still runs the old code.** `user/` is a copy,
refreshed at render time: re-run `hflow up` (idempotent; running
containers pick up the new files, secrets survive).

**"Is this costing me anything?"** No. The stack is local containers with
local storage; there is no hosted service, account, or metered anything
behind it. The costs are ~2 GB of images plus the venv on disk, and your CPU
while runs execute.

## Runtime overhead

In the spirit of [the benchmark report](./BENCHMARKS.md): the runtime has a
latency floor. Know where it is before you attribute slowness to your own code.

Airflow schedules tasks in *seconds*, not milliseconds. Every sub-DAG task
also boots a fresh interpreter in your venv (the external-python isolation is
paid per task), each enabled stage is its own sub-DAG run of at minimum three
tasks (`plan`, one mapped `process_batch`, the gate) behind a master trigger
task, and batch starts add deliberate stagger delays (a full-profile run is
four sub-DAG runs in sequence; `--profile` trims it, `--online` removes the
stagger but not the per-task floor).
Ingesting one two-second episode therefore takes orders of magnitude longer
under the DAG than the sub-second transform inside it: pure orchestration
overhead. This is the design trade: the architecture keeps steps coarse (one
task processes a *batch* and runs for seconds to minutes, hot loops live
inside a task, never across tasks) so the per-task floor is amortized over
real work.

Two consequences to act on:

- **Never iterate on a check through the DAG.** That is what `app.test()` is
  for: the identical pipeline, in-process, seconds per cycle, no floor. The
  runtime exists for throughput over batches, retries, and observability,
  not for the edit-run loop.
- **Feed the DAG batches, not single files.** The floor is per *task*, so ten
  episodes in one `ingest` cost roughly the same overhead as one episode.
  The planner exists to spread real work evenly, not to make tiny runs fast.
