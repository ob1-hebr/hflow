# HFlow architecture for Physical AI data pipelines

HFlow is an open-source reimplementation of the data-infrastructure architecture described in Dyna Robotics' ["Training Dyna-2 at million-hour scale, repeatably"](https://www.dyna.co/research/dyna-2-infrastructure) (Aug 2026), redesigned for single-tenant use at small scale. It applies the same infrastructure to multimodal physical-AI data from human egocentric collection, robot teleoperation, autonomous policy rollouts, and other sensor-rich sources.

Because the blog post describes goals and mechanisms without full specifications, this document marks the provenance of every load-bearing decision:

- **Dyna says**: stated in the blog post, adopted directly.
- **HFlow chooses**: our engineering judgment filling a gap the post leaves open, with the evidence behind it.

The governing trade: **democratize the architecture, defer the optimizations.**
This is an independent implementation of ideas described in the post, not
Dyna's source code and not a claim of drop-in or byte-for-byte compatibility.
The post does not publish a complete file-format or service specification.

## What is different from Dyna

This table is the short version of the implementation boundary. **Implemented**
means the capability exists in this repository at small scale; **simplified**
means HFlow preserves the interface or intent with a single-tenant design;
**deferred** means possible future work, not a release commitment; and **out of
scope** means it is deliberately not part of this repository.

| Area | Dyna's published architecture | HFlow today | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle boundary | Collection through training-batch loading | Starts from landed MCAP files and ends at curated MCAP plus a Parquet manifest; data-collection systems and training/loading are not included | **Partial by design** |
| Input formats and triggering | Data from multiple sources and vendors lands in a bucket | MCAP input only, triggered explicitly through the SDK/CLI or Airflow API; no bucket/filesystem watcher | **Simplified; more readers deferred** |
| Canonical episode format | MCAP, H.264 GOPs matched to read patterns, topic-group chunking, and version stamps | An independently specified, standard-MCAP convention implementing those published ideas; interoperability is tested, but compatibility with Dyna's undisclosed internal layout is not claimed | **Implemented independently** |
| Ingestion graph and gates | Airflow transformation, quality-check, and enrichment stages with run profiles and critical/non-critical steps | The stage graph, profiles, quarantine gates, local Compose runtime, and bring-your-own Airflow bundle are implemented | **Implemented at small scale** |
| Checkpoint and replay | Durable pipeline state, checkpointable multi-day runs, replay from any step, cross-DAG artifact sharing, and selective reprocessing | Durable outputs, a sync completion marker, versioned catalog facts, stage-profile reruns that reuse the previous run's published canonical episode (cross-run artifact sharing through the data root), and `hflow stale` for selective reprocessing; no general arbitrary-step checkpoint/replay engine | **Partial; arbitrary-step replay deferred** |
| Per-step compute | Resources and worker allocation tailored to each step | `requires=`/`uses=` record intent, validate configured endpoint aliases, and put cheaper steps first; they do not yet route tasks to heterogeneous worker pools or probe GPU/endpoint health | **Deferred** |
| Batch scheduling | Byte-balanced batches and staggered starts, plus joint optimization against network, I/O, database, and worker limits | First-fit-decreasing byte balancing and deterministic stagger are implemented; the joint optimizer is not | **Simplified; optimizer deferred** |
| Catalog and curation | Transactional database, CDC, analytical warehouse, and a memory-mapped training manifest | Parquet catalog plus DuckDB SQL and Parquet manifests; no database/CDC/warehouse stack and no training dataloader | **Simplified; training loader out of scope** |
| Corpus caching and fleet orchestration | Alluxio/NVMe cache warming and training-fleet orchestration at million-hour scale | No distributed corpus cache, cache warmer, Slurm/Ansible fleet layer, or topology-aware training orchestration | **Out of scope** |
| Model-based enrichment | Production labels, captions, and segmentations | Hooks, frame/contact-sheet helpers, and examples; users supply models, clients, prompts, aggregation, and model-serving infrastructure | **Extension surface implemented; models out of scope** |
| Product/tenancy | An internal production system operating at Dyna's scale | One open-source, single-tenant workspace with no accounts, RBAC, or hosted control plane | **Simplified; hosted control plane is only a future direction** |

The detailed sections below explain why each substitution was made. The
remaining scale mechanisms are collected in [The scale path](#the-scale-path);
the issue tracker, rather than this document, is the source of truth for work
that is actually scheduled.

## Design tenets

1. **Evidence, not verdicts.** Quality checks record measurements, intervals, and tags. Pass/fail policy belongs to the consumer at curation time, never hardcoded into the corpus.
2. **Standard formats at every boundary; no proprietary data surfaces.** Episodes are standard MCAP (Foxglove/Rerun open them), runs are standard Airflow DAGs (Airflow's UI shows them), the catalog and manifests are Parquet (DuckDB/pandas/anything reads them). The dashboard (`hflow ui`) is a thin localhost viewer over those same surfaces -- Airflow's REST API and the Parquet catalog -- so nothing is hidden behind it and the system stays extensible without touching our code.
3. **Your code stays your code.** Transformations, checks, and enrichments are plain Python functions in the user's own environment. Existing processing code plugs in through small adapters rather than being rebuilt inside a framework.
4. **Ship code only where it earns its place.** Either the canonical format forces bridging (video lives in-band; nothing can read it without our accessors) or the code encodes a painfully-rediscoverable pitfall. We ship no client wrappers around things users already know (`openai`, `subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", ...])`); the examples are the documentation.
5. **Coarse-grained steps.** One task processes one episode or one batch and runs for seconds to minutes. Hot loops live inside a task, never across tasks.

## The data lifecycle

**Dyna says** (verbatim): robot data moves through "collection into a landing bucket, ingestion into training-ready episodes, curation into the dataset for a given experiment, and loading into training batches."

HFlow applies that lifecycle to physical-AI episode data regardless of who
or what generated it: human-worn sensors, a teleoperated robot, an autonomous
policy, or another multimodal collection system.

```
multimodal              landing              ingestion DAG                    catalog + curation
recording ───────────►  bucket/dir  ──API──► transform ─► QC gate ─► enrich ─► episodes.parquet
(human or robot)        (raw MCAP)  trigger  (canonical    (user      (user     │
                                              MCAP)         checks)    steps)   ▼ DuckDB SQL
                                                                               manifest.parquet
                                                                                │
                                                                                ▼
                                                                 delivery / conversion (separate package)
```

HFlow implements the first three stages. **Loading/training is out of scope**: the pipeline ends at curated, quality-tagged, version-stamped episodes plus a manifest, whether the next hop is a trainer or a data buyer.

### Landing and triggering

**Dyna says**: collection lands in a bucket. The trigger mechanism is unspecified.

**HFlow chooses**: ingestion is triggered by an API call. The SDK/CLI (`hflow ingest <uri>`) wraps Airflow's REST API v2 `dagRuns` endpoint with the episode/batch URI in the run conf. A collection rig or upload script calls it directly. A filesystem/bucket watcher is an optional convenience, not the core mechanism (Airflow cannot natively watch buckets; level-based file-exists triggers are explicitly prohibited upstream).

**v1 accepts MCAP only** (any chunking, any message encoding; this includes every rosbag2 recording, since MCAP is the ROS 2 default bag format). This is a format boundary, not a restriction to robot-originated data. Other readers (video + CSV, HDF5) are later plugins. The blog mentions external vendors "each with its own data types, formats, and quality quirks" but names no formats; starting MCAP-in is our simplification.

## The episode container: canonical MCAP

**Dyna says**: they moved from H5-holding-per-frame-JPEG to [MCAP](https://mcap.dev/) because it is video-optimizable, randomly accessible, flexibly chunked, and natively visualizable. Two tunings mattered most, and both are reproduced here:

1. **H.264 with GOP length matched to the read pattern.** Inter-frame compression cut storage ~68% versus per-frame JPEG. GOP length is a storage-vs-seek trade that depends on the consumer: VLA-style training samples short sparse windows (pays a keyframe seek per sample → short GOPs), world-model training reads long contiguous sequences (amortizes keyframes → long GOPs). HFlow exposes GOP as a writer preset keyed to model class, because the blog is explicit that this is effectively a training hyperparameter.
2. **Topic-group chunking.** MCAP's default writing gives each topic its own chunks, so assembling one training sample costs a read per topic. Dyna groups topics that share a read pattern and writes each group time-major: cameras interleaved in one chunk stream, proprioception + actions in another, never sharing a chunk. A sample then costs one read per *group*: adding a camera no longer adds a round trip. Dyna measured ~3.4× fewer chunk fetches and ~2.9× faster reads. No open-source MCAP writer implements this; HFlow's canonical writer does. Chunking changes write order, not the format, so **any conforming MCAP reader (Foxglove, Rerun, the stock `mcap` package) reads our files unmodified.**

3. **Version stamps.** **Dyna says** (verbatim): "Every processed episode also carries a stamp of what produced it: the schema version, the ingestion pipeline version, and the software version running on the robot when it was recorded." The corpus is assumed permanently mixed-version (reprocessing takes too long to ever be atomic), so curation filters by version range and stale episodes are found and reprocessed selectively. HFlow stamps every canonical episode with `schema_version`, `pipeline_version` (a content hash of the step configuration that produced it), and `robot_software_version` (from the source recording's metadata, when present).

**HFlow chooses** (the blog leaves these open):

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| How H.264 sits in MCAP | [`foxglove.CompressedVideo`](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/sdk/schemas/compressed-video) messages (Annex B, SPS/PPS on every keyframe, no B-frames) | The ecosystem-standard encoding; it is what makes Foxglove/Rerun viewability real, and "no native visualization" was one of Dyna's two stated reasons for abandoning H5 |
| Where stamps and episode semantics live | MCAP Metadata records (task, operator, success label, embodiment, version stamps); Attachments for calibration/URDF | Keeps the episode self-contained and viewer-inspectable; the blog says only that metadata is "indexed for manifest queries" (a database concern), not where it lives in-file |
| Compression codec | zstd chunks | The blog says "tuned compression" without naming a codec; zstd is the MCAP ecosystem default |
| Numeric parameters (GOP seconds, chunk sizes) | Configurable, with measured defaults | Not disclosed in the post; our benchmark report will publish what we measure |

On-disk identifiers (metadata record names, channel naming) are neutral and format-versioned: they never embed the project name, so stored data is independent of branding.

**Acceptance test for every file the pipeline writes: it opens cleanly in Foxglove and Rerun.**

The full normative convention lives in [FORMAT.md](./FORMAT.md).

## Ingestion: the Airflow DAG

**Dyna says**: their original single-Kubernetes-job pipeline was rewritten as an Airflow DAG with three stage families: **data transformation** (resample all streams onto a common timestamp grid, compute derived signals, encode canonical MCAP, index metadata), **quality check** (a runtime-toggleable pre/post gate around transformation), and **feature enrichment** (performance labels, captions, segmentations). The rewrite bought per-step resource allocation, critical/non-critical step tagging (a non-critical failure doesn't cancel the run), and per-run step toggles ("run profiles": full processing, metadata-only backfill, re-label pass). Pipeline state is "backed with durable storage rather than keeping them in a live process," enabling checkpointable runs, replay from any step, cross-DAG artifact sharing, and selective reprocessing.

HFlow adopts the stage model, run profiles, and critical/non-critical gate
semantics: the three-stage skeleton is fixed, and user steps hang off it. Its
replay boundary is currently a stage, not every individual user step; see
[What is different from Dyna](#what-is-different-from-dyna).

### Transform

The built-in transform resamples streams onto a common grid, computes derived signals, and writes the canonical episode. Users override at three levels: **configure** it (grid rate, GOP preset, topic-group assignment, per-signal interpolate-vs-nearest policy); **extend** it (register derived-signal functions); or **replace** it (`@app.transform`); a custom transform still ends by calling the canonical-writer library function, so downstream contracts hold. The multi-rate alignment policy is explicit, versioned, and configurable because it is where format converters silently diverge.

### Steps and resources

**Dyna says** each DAG step gets resources "tailored to its specific
requirements." In HFlow, a step can declare `requires={"gpu"}` and
`uses="judge"` (a named endpoint alias), but the current implementation uses
those declarations only to validate that named endpoint aliases are configured
and to order plain steps before resource-declaring steps. It does **not** yet
probe endpoint health or GPU visibility, or route individual steps to
heterogeneous Airflow worker pools. A bring-your-own Airflow deployment must
currently arrange those resources outside HFlow.

### Batching

**Dyna says**: at scale, the scheduler database became the choke point; the fixes were staggered batch start times and bin-packing input batches into near-equal *bytes* (file sizes vary widely and unbalance workers). Both mechanisms are small, so HFlow includes simple versions in v1: a planning task runs first-fit-decreasing over file sizes into near-equal-byte groups for mapped tasks, and batch starts are spaced by a configurable stagger interval (deterministic even spacing, which desynchronizes identical steps at least as well as random jitter and reproduces exactly). What stays on the scale path is Dyna's joint optimizer tuning worker counts against network/IO/DB constraints.

### Deployment modes

Airflow cannot be a normal pip dependency: its own maintainers state unconstrained installs "will not work from time to time," and its ~128-package footprint would collide with users' ML stacks. The SDK is therefore dependency-light and *provisions or targets* a runtime rather than importing one:

1. **Docker mode (default).** `hflow up` renders a Compose bundle: Airflow 3.x services + Postgres + a worker container; the data root is a host directory mounted into the containers, or an object-store prefix (`s3://`, `gs://`, Azure) the tasks talk to natively (see [the runtime guide](./RUNTIME.md)). The SDK generates a private DAG-bundle directory (Airflow 3's `dag_bundle_config_list`) and pre-sets the configuration that traps newcomers (`dags_are_paused_at_creation=False`, examples off, object-storage-backed XCom so large accidental returns never hit the metadata DB).
2. **Bring-your-own Airflow.** `hflow deploy` emits the same DAG bundle as plain files plus a light runtime package for an existing deployment (Astronomer, MWAA, Cloud Composer, self-managed); the data root is either an absolute filesystem path visible on every worker or an object-store prefix (`s3://`, `gs://`, Azure). Bucket roots use an obstore-backed local mirror, so media processing still receives ordinary local files while durable publication stays store-native.

**Dependency isolation:** the worker image carries two environments, Airflow's own and a dedicated pip-built venv from the user's requirements. User steps execute in the user's venv (external-python pattern), so user dependencies and Airflow's pins never meet. The worker image is user-extensible (own base image, extra system packages) so a check needing a system library never requires touching HFlow.

**Dev loop:** `app.test(episode)` runs the entire pipeline in-process on one episode: no Docker, no scheduler, no Airflow import at all (a plain Python runner with the same gate semantics, wrapping the `app.process()` operation the DAG maps over). Iterate on a check in seconds; `app.run()` when it works.

**Observability splits by altitude.** The dashboard (`hflow ui`, see [UI.md](./UI.md)) is the pipeline-level view: live runs, per-stage status, catalog stats. Step-level observability stays Airflow's own UI, exposed on localhost in Compose mode -- the blog cites "the status of each step is clearly observed from the DAG" as a benefit, and run rows deep-link into it. The SDK also adds plain-language diagnostics for embedder-specific traps (`hflow status`).

### Data passing

Steps pass references (URIs, episode ids) and small measurements, never media bytes. Multi-gigabyte artifacts move through the data root; Airflow XCom is configured with an object-storage backend as a safety net.

## Quality checks and curation

The blog pins down *where* QC sits and *what* it catches: quality checks run "as their own pre/post gate around transformation," toggleable at runtime; they "detected and filtered out quality issues such as camera blackout, choppy joint states, missing/occluded hand positions, bad frames"; and quality outcomes are queryable at curation time ("by whether the run succeeded, by whether a camera dropped out"). It does not specify what a check outputs, any thresholds, or whether "filtered out" means deleted or tagged.

**HFlow chooses** a three-layer model, grounded in published curation research:

**Layer 1: checks output measurements, not verdicts.** A check returns numbers, time intervals, and optional tags; everything lands in the episode's catalog row regardless of pass/fail. Rationale: the same stored measurements support different policies without rerunning media processing, and quality heuristics are known to *invert* on real defects ([Voxel51's audit](https://voxel51.com/blog/robot-data-quality-scoring) found smoothness metrics scoring an early-gripper-release defect *better* than clean demos). A hardcoded verdict bakes the wrong call into the corpus; a measurement lets you re-decide with a query.

**Layer 2: gates are optional policy on critical checks.** A check may declare a user-owned `verdict` predicate. A failed **critical** verdict tags the episode `quarantined:<check>` and skips its downstream steps (no enrichment spend on an episode with a dead camera); a failed non-critical verdict records a tag and the run proceeds (exactly the blog's critical/non-critical semantics). Quarantine is a tag, never a deletion: the field's strongest teams keep failures ([DROID](https://droid-dataset.github.io/) releases them, [1X trains on them](https://www.1x.tech/discover/redwood-ai), RoboMIND annotates their causes). A check *crashing* is infrastructure, not data: it retries and can fail the run, but is never recorded as a bad episode.

**Layer 3: curation is SQL over everything layer 1 recorded.** Measurements are catalog columns; a curation query emits `manifest.parquet`. Every measurement row carries the check's version (a content hash of its configuration), so re-running a changed check appends new-version rows and curation can pin exact versions (versions are content hashes, so pins are equality or set membership, never ordered ranges): the mixed-version-corpus reality, applied to checks. The other half of that reality is selective reprocessing: `hflow stale` (`hflow.stale_episodes`) lists exactly which sources' latest runs predate the current pipeline/format versions, ready to pipe back into `hflow ingest` -- the blog's "find exactly which episodes are stale and reprocess only those".

Dataset-level reporting includes **coverage denominators** (which checks ran on what fraction of episodes) because a statistic over half a delivery must not look like a statistic over all of it.

### The check library and the porting story

Porting existing QC code is the primary onboarding story:

```python
from your_existing_qc import check_joint_smoothness  # untouched


@app.check()
def joint_smoothness(ep: hflow.Episode) -> hflow.CheckResult:
    joints = ep.channel("/joint_states").to_numpy()  # extract
    result = check_joint_smoothness(joints, rate_hz=100)  # unchanged
    return hflow.CheckResult(measurements=result)  # record
```

The accessor surface is chosen by asking what existing robotics QC scripts take as input: `ep.video(camera)` (lossless remux of in-band H.264 to MP4, no re-encode), `ep.frames(camera, fps=...)` (JPEG frames), `ep.channel(topic).to_numpy() / .to_arrow()`, `ep.metadata`. Users who want none of it can open `ep.path` with the raw `mcap` package; the file is standard MCAP.

Built-in checks ship in the same shape users write, doubling as documentation. The starting set mirrors Dyna's named issues plus the field's established integrity checks: timestamp regularity (1/fps ± tolerance, [LeRobot's check](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)) with cross-stream sync, camera blackout/freeze/exposure and frame count vs expected rate (`camera_frame_stats`), joint discontinuity vs velocity limits, and idle fraction. The camera checks run as a **single-decode ffmpeg instrument**: blackframe + freezedetect + signalstats in one filter graph, so all three share one frame denominator and one decode. Two of the classic cuts are corpus-relative judgments, so their checks record evidence and the decision is a curation query: `episode_duration` for length outliers, and `content_digest` for exact-duplicate detection (a `GROUP BY ... HAVING count(*) > 1`). Motion-smoothness metrics ship as flags only, never default reject rules (the Voxel51 inversion result). Thresholds are always user-owned.

### Model-based checks

**Dyna says** enrichment "generates performance labels, video captions, segmentations". Model-based steps exist; mechanisms are unspecified.

**HFlow chooses** frames-only VLM usage in v1: most models and the OpenAI-compatible protocol don't natively support video, so the honest unit is the frame. The user extracts frames explicitly (`ep.frames(fps=...)`), calls their own client (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, hosted or self-run vLLM/Ollama; each step names its endpoint), and owns the aggregation of per-frame answers. There is no bundled VLM client; examples show plain `openai` calls. Two helpers survive because they encode non-obvious value: the **contact sheet** (N timestamped frames composited into one image; works even on single-image models, cheap on vision tokens) and frame extraction itself. Dyna's "missing/occluded hand positions" is the canonical example of this surface -- hand visibility is a model judgment, not a signal statistic, and the [OpenAI vision example](../examples/openai_vision/pipeline.py) shows it as a contact-sheet VLM check. Native-video protocols are a contributor-shaped provider extension point.

## Catalog and curation storage

**Dyna says**: manifest-building by walking files took ~48 hours at 43M episodes; the fix was a transactional production DB CDC-replicated into an analytical warehouse, making curation a SQL query that writes a columnar manifest, memory-mapped by training ranks.

**HFlow chooses** the single-tenant collapse of the same interface: the ingest DAG appends one row per episode to Parquet under the data root, and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) queries it directly. That is the same researcher-facing SQL (filter by task, robot, success, sensor dropout, pinned versions) with zero additional services. The warehouse/CDC split solves contention between transactional load and columnar scans at tens of millions of rows; a single-tenant deployment with thousands of episodes doesn't have that problem. The manifest is Parquet; Dyna's download-once/mmap/zero-copy-shard loading trick lives in a training dataloader we don't ship, and is documented as [a recipe](./how-to/load-manifest-mmap.md) for users who need it.

## Storage and durability

**Dyna says** the requirements: durable externally-stored pipeline state; checkpointable multi-day runs; replay from any step; selective reprocessing. The mechanisms are unspecified.

**HFlow chooses** a small-scale durability model drawn from production
experience with Pareto. Today, canonical outputs and catalog facts are durable,
the sync stage has a persisted completion marker, and run profiles can replay a
stage -- a later run (a relabel pass, a different profile) consumes the
canonical episode a previous run published, which is cross-DAG artifact
sharing in miniature, through the data root. A general content-addressed
checkpoint for every user step and replay from an arbitrary step remain design
targets rather than current guarantees:

- One local-directory-or-bucket **data root** holds everything durable; pipeline processes are stateless. Bucket roots download through an etag-validated per-worker mirror and publish canonical episodes and artifacts back to the store. Catalog appends use store-native create-if-absent writes.
- **Content-addressed artifacts (target)**: derived outputs will be addressed by
  a hash of exactly the inputs that determine their bytes (configuration,
  instrument identity, model id). Changing a prompt or a filter graph should
  create a parallel artifact directory, never a migration.
- **Completion markers (implemented narrowly)**: the sync stage publishes a
  completion marker after the canonical episode, so a later stage or run can
  prove the canonical it consumes was fully written for this source. Extending
  the same create-if-absent checkpoint contract to every user step is deferred.
- **Manifest-last publication (target)**: a build directory is sealed by
  writing its manifest once, last, so partial builds are unreachable by
  construction.
- **Two-axis failure taxonomy**: (data-scoped vs infrastructure) × (transient vs terminal). Transients retry in place; terminal data errors quarantine the episode within a budget (mass failure fails the run loudly); infrastructure trouble is never recorded as bad data.

## Language choice

**Pure Python for all first-party v1 code.** The compute-heavy work in this pipeline already runs in native code: video is FFmpeg (C, subprocess) and chunk decompression is C zstd (~2.6 GB/s measured through the pure-Python `mcap` package). Parallelism is process-level via Airflow tasks, so the interpreter is never the unit of concurrency. The contributor pool for a robotics data tool writes Python.

The one measured bottleneck is per-message decoding of state channels in pure Python (~38k msgs/s): roughly seconds per episode against minutes of H.264 encode, i.e. not v1's constraint. The mitigation is architectural now, native later: video bytes are passed opaque (remuxed by ffmpeg, never message-decoded in Python), and the episode reader is a **batch-oriented interface** (decoded batches in, Arrow/bytes out). That shape lets a Rust-backed reader drop in behind the same interface as a non-blocking parallel track: PyO3 bindings over the official [`mcap` Rust crate](https://docs.rs/mcap/latest/mcap/), shipped as a separate wheel-distributing package with the pure-Python backend as its parity-tested fallback. Nothing in the pipeline waits on it. The one API rule that cannot be retrofitted is the interface shape: batch iterators, never per-message callbacks in the hot loop.

The pinned ffmpeg build is treated as a measuring instrument: a static build is auto-downloaded (never whatever is on PATH), and its version is recorded in every measurement's identity, because different ffmpeg versions genuinely produce different measurements.

## Tenancy

The open-source deployment is **single-tenant everything**: one workspace, no user management, no RBAC, which is the norm across comparable OSS infrastructure (Airbyte, Dagster, Prefect, Temporal, Langfuse). A future hosted offering would be a multi-tenant *control plane* over per-customer or customer-run data planes (the Dagster+/Prefect hybrid pattern): raw sensor data never transits the vendor, and the OSS single-tenant engine is the hosted data-plane unit. The design consequence taken now, because it cannot be cheaply retrofitted: only metadata, states, and pointers cross the control boundary, never episode bytes.

## The scale path

What Dyna does that HFlow defers, and what replaces it here:

| Dyna mechanism | Why they need it | HFlow v1 |
|---|---|---|
| Joint optimizer tuning worker counts vs network/IO/DB limits | millions of concurrent runs | simple FFD bin-packing + deterministic start stagger (included); tuning deferred |
| Production DB + CDC + analytical warehouse | 50M+ row columnar scans vs transactional load | Parquet catalog + DuckDB, same SQL interface |
| Alluxio page-level NVMe cache + warm-before-launch orchestration | PB corpus, multi-vendor GPU clusters | out of scope; documented pointer for those who need it |
| mmap/zero-copy manifest loading across ranks | 2 TB node RAM ceilings | [docs recipe](./how-to/load-manifest-mmap.md) (Arrow memory-map); trivial at small scale |
| Topology-aware optimizer sharding, Slurm preflight gating, Ansible fleet provisioning | training-side, week-long runs on rented fleets | out of scope; this is a data pipeline, not a trainer |

A benchmark report (tracked in issues) will publish what the simple version achieves and where each limit is: storage vs per-frame JPEG (Dyna: ~68% reduction), topic-group vs default chunking read performance (Dyna: ~2.9× faster), and single-machine ingestion throughput.
